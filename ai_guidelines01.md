  - Develop a unified approach to defining and executing automation tasks.
  - Create interfaces between the agent system and browser automation scripts.
- **Result Processing:** Integrate AI summarization with the agent's response handling.
- **Testing & Validation:** Thoroughly test the integrated agent and browser automation functionality.

### Phase 5: Optimization & Deployment
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Identify and resolve any performance bottlenecks in the integrated system.
  - Optimize data flow between components.
- **Comprehensive Testing:**
  - Conduct end-to-end testing of the integrated application.
  - Validate all user flows and automation scenarios.
- **Documentation Update:**
  - Update all documentation to reflect the integrated system.
  - Create new user guides for the enhanced functionality.
- **Deployment Configuration:**
  - Update deployment scripts and configurations.
  - Ensure all dependencies are properly managed for the integrated system.

## 3. System Prompt for Cline

When instructing Cline to assist with the integration, use the following system prompt:

```
You are tasked with integrating the Next.js-based reasonai03 application into the existing AI-Powered Browser Automation Tool. Follow these guidelines:

1. Code Analysis:
   - Carefully analyze both codebases to understand their structure, dependencies, and interactions.
   - Identify integration points and potential conflicts.

2. Architecture:
   - Maintain a clear separation of concerns while integrating components.
   - Use TypeScript interfaces to define boundaries between systems.
   - Design a unified state management approach that works across both systems.

3. Frontend Integration:
   - Migrate the browser automation UI to the component-based architecture.
   - Preserve the visual design elements from reasonai03 while incorporating necessary UI for automation tasks.
   - Ensure responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.

4. Backend Integration:
   - Create a seamless connection between Next.js API routes and Flask endpoints.
   - Maintain data consistency across the integrated system.
   - Implement proper error handling and logging throughout.

5. Agent Integration:
   - Connect the agent.ts functionality with browser automation capabilities.
   - Ensure the agent can receive tasks, control the browser, and process results.
   - Incorporate the retro-styled chat interface with browser automation feedback.

6. Testing:
   - Write tests for each integrated component.
   - Create integration tests that validate the entire workflow.
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios thoroughly.

7. Documentation:
   - Document the integration architecture and component interactions.
