# AI Browser Interaction: ReasonAI + Browser Automation Integration Guidelines

This document outlines the plan of action to integrate the browser automation capabilities of the Flask-based Browser-Use library with the reasoning structure of the ReasonAI (reasonai03) application. It includes detailed technical specifications, system prompts, and best practices for enabling AI-powered web browsing and interaction.

---

## 1. Integration Overview

**Objective:**  
Extend the ReasonAI reasoning framework to interact with the internet through browser automation, enabling the AI to browse websites, extract information, fill forms, and process web-based data while maintaining a structured reasoning approach to these tasks.

**Key Integration Components:**
- **Browser Action Module:** A TypeScript layer that interfaces between the ReasonAI agent and the Python-based browser automation backend.
- **Web Interaction Reasoning:** Enhanced agent reasoning patterns specific to web browsing and data extraction scenarios.
- **Response Processing:** Systems for summarizing and analyzing web content within the agent's reasoning steps.
- **Action Feedback Loop:** Mechanisms for the agent to adapt its browsing strategy based on website responses and extracted data.
- **Visual Context Integration:** Methods to incorporate screenshots and visual feedback into the agent's reasoning process.

---

## 2. System Architecture

### Browser Action Interface

The agent will be extended with a new module for browser interactions:

```typescript
// src/lib/browser-actions.ts
export interface BrowserAction {
  type: 'navigate' | 'extract' | 'click' | 'fill' | 'screenshot' | 'close';
  parameters: any;
}

export interface BrowserResult {
  success: boolean;
  data?: any;
  screenshot?: string; // Base64 encoded image
  error?: string;
}

export async function executeBrowserAction(action: BrowserAction): Promise<BrowserResult> {
  // Implementation will communicate with Flask backend
}
```

### Agent Integration

The agent.ts module will be enhanced to include browser-specific reasoning capabilities:

```typescript
// Enhanced Agent class with browser capabilities
class WebInteractionAgent extends Agent {
  // ... existing Agent properties
  
  private browser: {
    isActive: boolean;
    currentURL: string | null;
    history: string[];
  };
  
  constructor(options) {
    super(options);
    this.browser = {
      isActive: false,
      currentURL: null,
      history: []
    };
  }
  
  // Browser-specific methods to be added
  async browseTo(url: string): Promise<BrowserResult> { /* ... */ }
  async extractData(selectors: Record<string, string>): Promise<BrowserResult> { /* ... */ }
  async clickElement(selector: string): Promise<BrowserResult> { /* ... */ }
  async fillForm(formData: Record<string, string>): Promise<BrowserResult> { /* ... */ }
  async getScreenshot(): Promise<BrowserResult> { /* ... */ }
  async closeBrowser(): Promise<BrowserResult> { /* ... */ }
}
```

## 3. System Prompt for Browser-Enabled ReasonAI

The following system prompt should be used to guide the AI when integrating browser automation with reasoning steps:

```
You are an AI agent with the ability to browse and interact with the internet. You have access to browser automation functions that allow you to navigate to websites, extract information, click elements, fill forms, and capture screenshots. 

When browsing the web, carefully follow these steps in your reasoning process:

1. PLANNING: First, determine what information you need to find or what web task you need to complete. Break this down into clear steps, thinking about:
   - What websites would contain the information needed
   - What navigation paths would be required
   - What data should be extracted or what interactions performed

2. NAVIGATION: When visiting a website, reason about:
   - The structure of the URL you're accessing
   - Any expected login requirements or paywalls
   - How the website might organize the information you seek

3. INTERACTION: When you need to interact with web elements:
   - Identify the most specific CSS selectors to target exactly what you need
   - Plan multi-step interactions carefully (e.g., navigate → fill form → click submit)
   - Consider timing and waiting for page loads between interactions

4. EXTRACTION: When extracting information:
   - Define precise selectors for the data you want
   - Consider alternative data locations if primary extraction fails
   - Reason about how to clean and structure the extracted information

5. PROCESSING: After obtaining web data:
   - Evaluate the quality and relevance of the information
   - Synthesize information from multiple sources if needed
   - Apply critical thinking to verify the accuracy of information
   - Format the information appropriately for the original task

6. ADAPTATION: If your initial approach doesn't work:
   - Analyze why the approach failed
   - Consider alternative websites, navigation paths, or selectors
   - Revise your strategy based on what you've learned

Always maintain a clear reasoning trail documenting your browser interactions, observations of website content, and how the information contributes to the overall task. When extracting information, focus on relevance to the task and organize it in a way that supports your final output.

Remember that websites change over time, so your interaction strategy may need to adapt if you encounter unexpected layouts or content.
```

## 5. Technical Implementation Details

### Browser Action API Endpoints

The Flask backend will expose the following endpoints for browser automation:

```python
@app.route('/api/browser/navigate', methods=['POST'])
def navigate_browser():
    """Navigate the browser to a URL"""
    data = request.json
    url = data.get('url')
    session_id = data.get('session_id', str(uuid.uuid4()))
    
    # Get or create browser session
    browser = get_browser_session(session_id)
    
    success = browser.navigate_to_url(url)
    screenshot = get_screenshot(browser) if success else None
    
    return jsonify({
        'success': success,
        'session_id': session_id,
        'screenshot': screenshot,
        'url': url if success else None
    })

@app.route('/api/browser/extract', methods=['POST'])
def extract_data():
    """Extract data from the current page"""
    data = request.json
    selectors = data.get('selectors', {})
    session_id = data.get('session_id')
    
    browser = get_browser_session(session_id)
    extracted_data = browser.extract_data(selectors)
    
    return jsonify({
        'success': True if extracted_data else False,
        'data': extracted_data,
        'screenshot': get_screenshot(browser)
    })

# Additional endpoints for click, fill, etc.
```

### Browser Action Client Implementation

The TypeScript client for browser actions:

```typescript
// src/lib/browser-client.ts
export async function navigateTo(url: string, sessionId?: string): Promise<BrowserResult> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/browser/navigate', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ url, session_id: sessionId })
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Navigation failed');
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'
    };
  }
}

// Additional client methods for extraction, clicking, etc.
```

### Integration with Agent Reasoning

The agent's reasoning process will be extended to incorporate browser actions:

```typescript
private async executeWebStep(step: Step): Promise<string> {
  // Extract web action from step description
  const webActions = this.parseWebActions(step.description);
  
  let result = '';
  
  for (const action of webActions) {
    // Execute the browser action
    let actionResult: BrowserResult;
    
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'navigate':
        actionResult = await this.browseTo(action.parameters.url);
        break;
      case 'extract':
        actionResult = await this.extractData(action.parameters.selectors);
        break;
      // Handle other action types
    }
    
    // Process the result
    if (!actionResult.success) {
      result += `Failed to ${action.type}: ${actionResult.error}\n`;
      // Try recovery strategy if applicable
      const recovery = await this.generateRecoveryStrategy(action, actionResult);
      if (recovery) {
        result += `Recovery strategy: ${recovery}\n`;
        // Execute recovery
      }
    } else {
      result += `Successfully executed ${action.type}.\n`;
      if (actionResult.data) {
        result += `Extracted data: ${JSON.stringify(actionResult.data, null, 2)}\n`;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}

private async generateRecoveryStrategy(
  failedAction: BrowserAction, 
  result: BrowserResult
): Promise<string | null> {
  const prompt = `
  You attempted a browser action that failed:
  Action: ${failedAction.type}
  Parameters: ${JSON.stringify(failedAction.parameters)}
  Error: ${result.error}
  
  Suggest a recovery strategy for this failed browser action.
  `;
  
  return this.callOllama(prompt);
}
```

## 6. Web Reasoning Patterns

The following reasoning patterns should be implemented in the agent to handle common web interaction scenarios:

### Information Gathering Pattern

```
1. Determine search keywords and relevant websites
2. Navigate to search engine or directly to known information sources
3. Extract search results or navigate site hierarchy
4. Evaluate information relevance and credibility
5. Extract specific data points needed for the task
6. Synthesize information from multiple sources
7. Format extracted information for final output
```

### Web Form Interaction Pattern

```
1. Identify the form that needs to be completed
2. Break down form into individual fields and requirements
3. For each field:
   a. Determine the appropriate selector
   b. Generate or retrieve the required input
   c. Fill the field with proper formatting
4. Locate and plan interaction with submission elements
5. Submit the form and verify success
6. Handle any errors or follow-up forms
7. Extract confirmation details or next steps
```

### Data Extraction Pattern

```
1. Analyze page structure to identify data containers
2. Determine patterns for repeated elements (e.g., list items, table rows)
3. Create selectors for specific data points
4. Extract data systematically with fallback selectors
5. Clean and normalize extracted data
6. Verify data integrity and completeness
7. Structure data according to task requirements
```

### Dynamic Content Interaction Pattern

```
1. Identify if the page uses dynamic loading
2. Determine triggers for content loading (scroll, click, etc.)
3. Plan interaction sequence to reveal needed content
4. Implement waiting strategies between interactions
5. Verify content appearance before extraction
6. Extract data from dynamically loaded elements
7. Repeat interaction-verification-extraction as needed
```

## 7. Best Practices for Browser-Enabled AI Reasoning

- **Sequential Interaction:**  
  - Browser actions should be executed in a carefully planned sequence
  - Each action should wait for the previous action to complete
  - Include appropriate waits for page loading and dynamic content

- **Resilient Selectors:**  
  - Prefer semantic selectors that are less likely to change (IDs, aria attributes)
  - Include fallback selectors for critical elements
  - Consider multiple approaches to locate important elements

- **Contextual Awareness:**  
  - Maintain awareness of the current page state
  - Track navigation history to understand user journey
  - Consider how extracted data relates to the overall task

- **Error Recovery:**  
  - Implement strategies to handle common failures (elements not found, navigation errors)
  - Include logic to retry actions with different approaches
  - Document encountered errors to improve future interactions

- **Data Verification:**  
  - Validate extracted data against expected patterns
  - Cross-reference information from multiple sources when possible
  - Apply critical thinking to assess information quality

- **Ethical Browsing:**  
  - Respect robots.txt and website terms of service
  - Implement rate limiting for requests
  - Avoid scraping personal or sensitive information
  - Consider the load placed on websites during interaction

- **Visual Feedback:**  
  - Capture screenshots at key interaction points
  - Use visual context to inform reasoning about page structure
  - Annotate screenshots to highlight relevant elements

## 8. Step Augmentation for Web Tasks

When executing web-related tasks, the standard agent steps should be augmented with web-specific considerations:

### 1. Goal Analysis
**Standard:** Understand the task objective  
**Web Augmentation:** Identify which aspects require web browsing, what websites might contain the information, and what types of interactions will be needed.

### 2. Planning
**Standard:** Break the task into logical steps  
**Web Augmentation:** Plan a browsing strategy, including starting URLs, navigation paths, and critical data points to extract.

### 3. Execution
**Standard:** Perform actions to fulfill each step  
**Web Augmentation:** Execute browser actions in sequence, adapting to the actual content encountered on websites.

### 4. Integration
**Standard:** Incorporate results from each step  
**Web Augmentation:** Process extracted web data, combining information from multiple pages and sources.

### 5. Refinement
**Standard:** Evaluate and improve intermediate results  
**Web Augmentation:** Assess whether extracted data meets needs, plan additional browsing if needed.

### 6. Synthesis
**Standard:** Compile final comprehensive output  
**Web Augmentation:** Structure web-sourced information in a coherent format that addresses the original goal.

## 9. Implementation of Browser Actions in Agent Steps

To enable the agent to use browser actions effectively, each step's execution will include:

1. **Action Identification:**
   ```typescript
   private identifyBrowserActions(stepDescription: string): BrowserAction[] {
     // Analyze step description to identify browser actions
     // Return an array of browser actions to perform
   }
   ```

2. **Action Execution:**
   ```typescript
   private async executeBrowserActions(
     actions: BrowserAction[], 
     stepNumber: number
   ): Promise<string> {
     let results = '';
     
     for (const action of actions) {
       // Execute the action
       const result = await executeBrowserAction(action);
       
       // Add to reasoning based on result
       if (this.onReasoningToken) {
         await this.onReasoningToken(
           stepNumber, 
           `\nExecuted ${action.type}: ${result.success ? 'Success' : 'Failed'}\n`
         );
       }
       
       // Process the result
       results += this.processBrowserResult(action, result);
     }
     
     return results;
   }
   ```

3. **Result Processing:**
   ```typescript
   private processBrowserResult(
     action: BrowserAction, 
     result: BrowserResult
   ): string {
     if (!result.success) {
       return `Failed to ${action.type}: ${result.error}\n`;
     }
     
     switch (action.type) {
       case 'navigate':
         return `Successfully navigated to ${action.parameters.url}\n`;
       case 'extract':
         return `Extracted data: ${JSON.stringify(result.data, null, 2)}\n`;
       // Handle other action types
       default:
         return `Successfully completed ${action.type}\n`;
     }
   }
   ```
