# AI-Powered Browser Automation Tool: Development Guidelines

This document outlines the plan of action to iteratively build the AI-Powered Browser Automation Tool using Ollama and the Browser-Use library. It includes detailed milestones, best software engineering practices, and a system prompt to guide the LLM during the construction process.

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Develop a lightweight application that automates repetitive web tasks by leveraging the Browser-Use library for web interactions and Ollama’s AI for data processing and summarization. The application will allow users to define automation tasks (e.g., gathering news summaries, data extraction) via a simple web interface.

**Key Components:**
- **Frontend:** User interface for task configuration and result display (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Backend:** Flask-based server handling API requests, task scheduling, and integration with both Browser-Use and Ollama.
- **Automation Scripts:** Python modules that utilize the Browser-Use library to perform web automation.
- **AI Processing:** Integration with Ollama’s language models to process and summarize data collected from the web.

## 2. Iterative Development Plan

### Iteration 1: Environment Setup & Basic API
- **Setup Version Control:** Initialize a Git repository.
- **Create Project Structure:** Organize folders for frontend, backend, and automation scripts.
- **Install Dependencies:** 
  - Python packages: Flask, requests, Browser-Use, Ollama SDK.
  - Frontend libraries (if any): e.g., Bootstrap for rapid prototyping.
- **Develop a Basic Flask API:** Create endpoints for:
  - Testing connectivity.
  - Receiving task definitions.
  - Returning static responses.
- **Write Initial Documentation:** Document setup steps and project structure.

### Iteration 2: Frontend & User Interaction
- **Design a Simple Web Interface:** 
  - Build HTML forms for users to input task details (e.g., target URL, task description).
  - Use JavaScript to handle form submissions and display API responses.
- **Connect Frontend to Backend:** Ensure that API endpoints are reachable and test form submission.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Add basic styling and validation for inputs.

### Iteration 3: Implement Browser Automation with Browser-Use Library
- **Develop Automation Scripts:**
  - Write Python modules that utilize the Browser-Use library for tasks like web navigation, data extraction, and form interactions.
  - Modularize scripts so that different tasks can be easily integrated.
- **Integrate with Flask Backend:**
  - Create endpoints that trigger automation scripts based on user inputs.
  - Handle responses and errors gracefully.
- **Logging & Debugging:** Add logging to track automation process and potential issues.

### Iteration 4: Integrate Ollama AI for Data Processing
- **Implement AI Summarization:**
  - Create functions that pass extracted data to Ollama’s language models.
  - Process and format the summarized output.
- **Connect AI Processing with Automation Workflow:**
  - After task execution, send the collected data to Ollama for summarization.
  - Return the summarized output to the frontend.
- **Testing & Error Handling:** Ensure the integration works reliably under different scenarios.

### Iteration 5: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for backend endpoints, automation scripts, and AI integration.
  - Test error cases, timeouts, and edge scenarios.
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Optimize code where necessary (e.g., reducing latency in automation tasks).
- **Final UI Improvements:**
  - Refine the frontend for better usability and responsiveness.
- **Deployment Setup:**
  - Prepare the application for local server deployment.
  - Document the deployment steps for further scaling or cloud deployment.

## 3. System Prompt for the LLM

When instructing the LLM to assist with coding, include the following system prompt to ensure best practices and clarity:

System Prompt:
“You are tasked with building the AI-Powered Browser Automation Tool. Adhere to the following software engineering best practices:
	•	Modular Design: Separate concerns by splitting the application into frontend, backend, and automation modules.
	•	Code Clarity & Readability: Write clean, well-documented code following PEP 8 guidelines for Python and best practices for JavaScript and HTML.
	•	Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging to capture and manage exceptions and edge cases.
	•	Test-Driven Development: Write unit tests for each component. Ensure code is testable and maintainable.
	•	Version Control: Use Git with descriptive commit messages to document iterative progress.
	•	User Experience: Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.
	•	Documentation: Comment code thoroughly and maintain up-to-date project documentation.
	•	Scalability & Maintenance: Write code with future enhancements in mind; avoid hardcoding and use configuration files where appropriate.
Iteratively develop the application by first setting up the environment, then building and testing small features incrementally before integrating them into the final product.”

## 4. Best Software Engineering Practices

- **Modularization:**  
  - Organize code into distinct modules (e.g., API endpoints, automation scripts, AI processing).
  - Ensure each module has a single responsibility.

- **Documentation & Comments:**  
  - Document every function and module with clear explanations.
  - Include README files that outline project setup, dependencies, and usage instructions.

- **Testing:**  
  - Implement unit tests for backend and frontend components.
  - Use continuous integration (CI) to automate testing (if applicable).

- **Error Handling & Logging:**  
  - Implement try-except blocks in Python to catch exceptions.
  - Log errors and significant events to assist in debugging.

- **Code Reviews & Iterative Feedback:**  
  - Conduct regular code reviews (even if self-review) to ensure adherence to best practices.
  - Iterate on feedback and update documentation accordingly.

- **Version Control:**  
  - Use Git for version control.
  - Commit frequently with descriptive messages and use branches for major features.

- **Security:**  
  - Validate user inputs on both frontend and backend.
  - Avoid exposing sensitive information in the codebase.

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Set up the project repository and directory structure.**
2. **Implement Iteration 1 (Environment Setup & Basic API) and test connectivity.**
3. **Iterate over subsequent iterations as outlined above, ensuring each phase is fully functional and tested before moving to the next.**
4. **Continuously integrate the system prompt guidelines during the development process.**

By following these guidelines, we can ensure a robust, maintainable, and user-friendly application built in an iterative and controlled manner.
